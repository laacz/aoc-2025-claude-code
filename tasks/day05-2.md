## \--- Part Two ---

The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute at the back of the kitchen.

So that they can stop bugging you when they get new inventory, the Elves would like to know _all_ of the IDs that the _fresh ingredient ID ranges_ consider to be _fresh_. An ingredient ID is still considered fresh if it is in any range.

Now, the second section of the database (the available ingredient IDs) is irrelevant. Here are the fresh ingredient ID ranges from the above example:

```
3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18
```

The ingredient IDs that these ranges consider to be fresh are `3`, `4`, `5`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, and `20`. So, in this example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider a total of _`14`_ ingredient IDs to be fresh.

Process the database file again. _How many ingredient IDs are considered to be fresh according to the fresh ingredient ID ranges?_
